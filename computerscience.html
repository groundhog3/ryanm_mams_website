    	<h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>CS is taught by Mrs. Taricco and in the class, we delve deep into computer science and its applications by learning various different tools and languages including HTML, CSS, and Java. In addition to programming, we also test our theoretical knowledge of CS by participating in competitions such as the American Computer Science League (ACSL). In the upcoming weeks, we will also start to work on Apps for Good which is a programming challenge that challenges students to write an application that can improve the livelihoods of a group of people in our community. As I’ve already taken AP Computer Science, I’m currently in the advanced track for CS in which I work on an independent project. I am currently working with web technologies and a tool provided by Google called Firebase to create a web app to automate and digitize the sign-in and sign-out system at Mass Academy. </p>

    	<h2>Project Euler</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of the year, we were asked to solve ten problems from Project Euler which are a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require algorithmic thinking to solve.</p>

    <h2 class="stem-h2 mt-4 mb-4">Apps For Good</h2>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Many existing charities do not have reliable systems for tracking donations and projecting their needs to the community. Most of these charities have reliable systems for ensuring transactions, but many charities lack a user-friendly interface for users to effectively determine where their donations/transactions would be most beneficial. In many local communities, citizens find themselves with extra goods and food items, but are not aware of places where their items are needed. There are charities that frequently request material and food donations - including common necessities like shirts, socks, pants, and food - but do not have an effective online interface to connect users and make their needs known. A system that effectively connects donors to charities that have certain necessities would be highly beneficial for the community, especially for charities that are not financial-based. </p>
        
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>A lot of existing charities do not have an effective donation system for users to enter their donations, and this arises in issues with tracking the quantity and type of donations.</p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The app will appeal to charities that want a streamlined donation process to handle inventory. Charities could also want to use the app as a way to spread the word about their mission. Individuals who want to donate items to people in need would use this app, as it would provide the users with many options for donating goods.</p>
        
        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <p>There are many options currently on the market that are aimed at connecting charities to their supporters. However, the majority of these apps are costly, and aimed solely at monetary donors or boosting charity publicity.</p>

        <p>One app, Aplos offers many fundraising and transaction options, including the ability to integrate donation forms and other information into websites. Although this application helps charities interact with their supporters and manage their funds, it does not benefit charities looking to accept material donations. Aplos is also incredibly costly, with a basic subscription ranging from $30-$180 a month. According to reviews, this tool also lacks search options and seems to have difficulty approving donors. Improving the user interface, implementing a free option, and adding material donation options would greatly improve this model.</p>


        <p>Donor Perfect is another software which helps charities engage with their donors and accept monetary donations. This is not a feasible option for smaller charities looking for specific, niche items. In addition, Donor Perfect has not yet been implemented into a universal mobile app, making it harder to access from all platforms. </p>

        <p>Another application, LetsAllDoGood, is aimed at smaller, local charities, specifically those looking to boost their publicity. This app offers notifications for donors, as well as the ability for charities to make a list of their supporters. Donors have the ability to pin charities and hear from them more often. However, donors may find that they get too many notifications and there is a very high cost for charities to join ($100-$3,000).</p>

        <p>In conclusion, these apps are mostly aimed at advertisement, collecting profit, and tracking monetary donations. Many of them lack a seamless user interface and designing a mobile application which benefits both donors and charities would greatly improve the way in which charities collect material donations from local citizens. </p>


        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Our app connects citizens in the Worcester area with charities looking for material donations. In the Minimum Viable Product, the app had these features: 
            <ol>
                <li>A charity can create a profile which will contain basic information about the charity (mission, contact, etc.)</li>
                <li>The charity’s profile can show items which are consistently needed by the particular organization, and the charity has the option to edit their profile and add more specific, niche items as well.</li>
                <li>The app can display the charities and their lists to a user, and match the user with a charity in need based on what that donor has to offer.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
