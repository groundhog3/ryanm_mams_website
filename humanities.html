        <h2>Class Description</h2> 
        <p>Humanities is taught by Ms. Small and it explores the question, “What does it mean to be human?” Through readings, group discussions, and open-ended writing prompts, we study what caused humanity to change over time and how humans handle that change.</p>

        <h2>Satire  Essay</h2>
        <p>This was the second essay we wrote in B Term which we studied various rhetorical devices used in satire. For the essay, we were tasked with finding a satirical piece we could relate to and writing an analysis of it. I chose to compare a satirical and serious article covering Elon Musk.</p>

        <h2>Bradbury Essay</h2>
        <p>This was the first essay we wrote in A Term that explored two dystopian texts by author Ray Bradbury, "August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains" and "The Pedestrian." There were a couple of prompts to choose from, but I chose to write an analytical essay that compared both stories.</p>
