         <p>
            Hello there once again! My name is Ryan Mechery and I’m a junior at
            MAMS. I was born in Worcester, MA and now live in Auburn. I
            previously went to <a href="https://www.saintpaulknights.org/">Saint
            Paul’s Diocesan Jr./Sr. Highschool</a>(formerly Holy Name) where I
            attended for four years – from seventh to tenth grade. In middle
            school I was involved with the Chorus program and Lego Mindstorms©.
            In high school, I was involved with Mock Trial, NHS, and served as my
            Class Treasurer.

         <h2 class="mb-3">Family</h2>
         <p>My sister and I were born here, but my parents were born in
            Kerala, India.

            style="width: 100%; margin: 0px auto">
         <p>My dad is a software engineer at Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., but I know him as a
            goofy person that tells really bad dad jokes. He always gives me good
            advice and really helped me with my transition to MAMS.
         </p>
         <p>My mom is a nurse at UMASS Memorial, and she is the funniest and quirkiest 
            person I know. I find it very easy to talk to her and she  always 
            encourages me when I am down.
         </p>
         <p>My sister’s name is Andrea, and she is a junior at UCONN. Even
            though we may not get along all the time, she always sticks up for me
            and she’s the best (and only) sister I know. She is also an alumnus
            of the Mass Academy class of 2019, so I've been getting a lot of tips
            about life at MAMS.
         </p>
         <p>All in all, my family has always been supportive and believed
            in me more than I did myself. Even when I applied to MAMS, they told
            me they were proud of my accomplishments, regardless of the results.
            For that, I can never thank them enough. With that being said, I
            encourage all the students reading my website to thank your parents
            and siblings for all their hard work and the trust they've confided
            within you.

         I'm the Junior Treasurer of a non-profit called the Kerala Association of New England. As Treasurer, I would normally be tasked with coordinating funds for fundraisers and bake sales. However, due to less in-person events in 2021 overall, that task was delegated to the organization's board for online transactions. The Junior committee, which is comprised of other highschool students, has helped organize two main events so far which were a virtual Spelling Bee and virtual Halloween event open to all children. 

         I'm still waiting on some pictures but I'll attach them when I recieve them
