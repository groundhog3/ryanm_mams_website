        <h2>Class Description</h2> 
        <p>French is taught by Mme. Wildfong and it’s a fully immersive class in which we only speak the language full-time. Through weekly listening journals, watching movies, listening to songs, and playing French games, we can expand our vocabulary and try new things in a low-stress environment. </p>

        <h2>Cooking Project</h2>
        <p>In B Term, one of our assignments was to pick a cuisine from a French-speaking country, cook it for the class, and create a presentation on the process. I chose to make des champignon farcis or stuffed mushrooms.</p>

        <h2>Meme Competition</h2>
        <p>During B Term, we had a meme competition where we were tasked with making the best French meme we could so that it could be put on a bulletin board. Attached below are some of the memes I created with a classmate, <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~dgkaminski">Daniel Kaminski</a>. The competition is still going and the bulletin board now has around twenty memes.</p>

        <h2>Fairy Tale</h2>
        <p>Towards the end of the B Term, we were tasked with writing a conte de fée or a fairy tale completely in French. My fairy tale is rather strange, but it describes a lonely goblin on his quest to find a good name.</p>
