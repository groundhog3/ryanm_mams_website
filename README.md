# Mass Academy Website

This is just a backup of the very first website I created as a junior at Mass Academy. 

Since we had to follow a rubric, the site was built with plain HTML and CSS (although I added Bootstrap in some areas later). 

Like many other STEM majors, my writing is very cringe but I'm impressed with the overall look. 

# Note
Instead of spending time updating the website's theme or adding content (like a normal person), I spent countless hours figuring out the best way to render a PDF. 

Since there was no way to deploy backend code, I found a deprecated pdfjs implementation that rendered the file client side. 

# Easter Eggs
I got so bored developing this website that different images pop up on certain pages if you refresh the page.
