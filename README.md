# Mass Academy Website

This is just a backup of the very first website I created as a junior at Mass Academy. 

Since we had to follow a rubric, the site was built with plain HTML and CSS (although I added Bootstrap in some areas later). 

## Thoughts

Looking back on it now, my writing is very cringe so plz ignore 🙏🏽. 

But overall, I'm impressed with the color scheme and how responsive it is (no js magic; just css media queries). 

## Fun Fact
Instead of spending time updating the website's theme or adding content, I spent countless hours figuring out the best way to render a PDF because Chrome's version sucks. 

Since I couldn't find a way to deploy server-side code, I found a deprecated pdfjs implementation that rendered the file client side. 

## Easter Eggs
I got so bored developing this website that different images pop up on certain pages if you refresh the page.
