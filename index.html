        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>If you see a picture of me, I can explain
            (refresh the page to see the bonus picture).
            I got picked up by a classmate in a skit we performed
            about the book <i>Walden</i> which all Juniors have to
            read during the summer. I don't want to spoil too much
            about Bournedale so you'll have to wait. Oh no, I've
            said to much. <b>My lips are sealed.</b></p>
