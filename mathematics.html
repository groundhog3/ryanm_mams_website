        <h2>Class Description</h2> 
        <p>Math Modeling is taught by Mr. Regele and in this class, we go over interesting problems, challenge ourselves to solve problems without a calculator, learn a language called Mathematica, participate in group presentations, and even work on mathematical modeling problems that use math to fix important world problems. The class is challenging but fosters creativity and allows us to think outside of the box with problems that aren’t clear at first glance.</p>

        <h2>HiMCM</h2>
        <p>HiMCM or the Highschool Mathematical Contest in Modeling is a 36-hour competition our entire grade participated in. The contest outlines two problems to pick from which are based on real-life world problems or events. Problem A is usually a data analysis type question in which a very sparse amount of data is given for a broad problem and your group must determine the optimal solution from those constraints. Problem B is more so, a data mining question in which a spreadsheet of data is given, and you must use mathematical or statistical tests to determine patterns in the data. To solve the problem, I worked in a group of four with <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~abapanapalli">Abhinav Bapanelli</a>, <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~sstadimeti">Sashank Tadimeti</a>, and <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~rsarwar">Raheel Sarwaar</a>. We were given the problem on a Wednesday, and we spent about an hour just discussing which problem to choose. For this year’s competition, Problem A focused on finding an optimal battery storage system for an off-grid, electrically powered home and Problem B focused on finding relations in measurements from Lake Mead. Both problems were compelling, but our group was more interested in doing Problem A because we liked the research aspect that it required and we also found the topic very interesting. To come up with our solution, our group did a lot of research into different types of battery systems and energy usage in an off-grid home and came up with a ranking system of the most important criteria of a battery. Using those criteria, we created a series of decision trees and found that for a variety of usage needs, using 1-2 Tesla Powerwalls would serve sufficient. Our group had a lot of fun with the problem and although it got tough at times, we were able to brainstorm and tackle those problems without a hitch. Attached below is the 23-page paper our group wrote. </p>

        <h2>Epsilon School</h2>
        <p>This was a smaller, mathematical modeling problem that our class worked on in groups as preparation for HiMCM. Due to an influx of students, a STEM school had to build a new wing in the school. Additionally, the school decided that it could only hire seven additional faculty. Given an enrollment list and subjects taken by previous students, we were tasked with determining the optimal subject for each faculty hire. I worked on this presentation with <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~mkzheng">Maya Zheng</a> and <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~rdas2">Rohan Das</a> and after spending a couple of hours solving the problem, we created a presentation and presented our model and findings to the class.</p>

        <h2>Hanford Mathematica Writeup</h2>
        <p>In this assignment, we worked on a modeling problem and created a write-up in a language called Mathematica. The problem was based on radioactive poisoning in which we were tasked with finding a relation between an index of exposure and cancer deaths per 100,000 deaths in different counties in Hanford, Washington.</p>
