        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>Physics is taught by Mr. Ellis and it is a challenging yet mentally stimulating class that teaches conceptual physics through lots and lots of problem-solving. Through end-of-chapter problems (EOCS), rigorous tests, Excel writeups, and formal problem writeups, we learn many of the tools we need to think and work like physicists. For those who have previously studied Calculus, or want to try something new, a Calculus track is offered which lines up with the AP Physics C curriculum.</p>

        <h2>Über Rocket</h2>
        <p>Every term, Mr. Ellis assigns us a physics problem to solve that has many different parts to get a final answer. With the Über Rocket problem, we were tasked with determining the total time a rocket traveled through the air with different accelerations. Once we solve the problem, we create a formal write-up in Microsoft Word.</p>

        <h2>Physics Simulation</h2>
        <p>The physics simulation was an extra credit option in which you had to create an interactive program that could model projectile motion in 2d with outputs displayed. I chose to work with Javascript along with the p5.js library for the coding and Bootstrap was used as a stylesheet. Although the animation is a little bit glitchy, you can still play around with the demo below. The source code can be found at this <a href="https://github.com/groundhog3/Projectile_Motion_Simulation" target="_external">Github link</a>.</p>
